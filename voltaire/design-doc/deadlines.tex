\section{Deadlines and Stability Windows}
\label{sect:deadlines}

In order to ensure the stability and security of the blockchain, it is essential that updates are known sufficiently in advance of an epoch boundary.
Independent deadlines may be set for voting and endorsement.  These deadlines must respect these timing and stability constraints.
The constraints are as follows.

\begin{tabular}{||l|p{2in}|p{3in}||}
  \hline\hline
  \textbf{What} & \textbf{When} & \textbf{Description} \\
  \hline
  Submission & Within 2 stability windows of the start of an epoch & \\
  \hline
  Voting & No less than 1 stability window before the end of the epoch prior to enactment & \\
  \hline
  Endorsement & No less than 1 stability window before the end of the epoch prior to enactment & \\
  \hline
  Enactment & At a specific epoch boundary & \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}

As described in Appendix~\ref{sect:parameters}, limits on these settings are captured by specific non-updatable protocol parameters:
\texttt{LatestEndorsementDeadline},
\texttt{LatestVotingDeadline},
\texttt{LatestProposalDeadline}.
These define the relative slots in an epoch by which the specified events must be carried out.  They may be derived from security parameters.
