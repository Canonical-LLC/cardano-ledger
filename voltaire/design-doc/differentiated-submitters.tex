\section{Possible Extension to Differentiated Submitter Groups}

This design assumes a single group of submitters.  It
would instead be possible to differentiate proposals, so that specific kinds of proposal
could be submitted by different sub-groups.  For example, a sub-group of submitters might have
authority to submit a proposal that changed specific parameters, that authorised
funds transfers up to some amount, that transferred balances between reserves
and treasury, or between treasury and specific nominated accounts.  The obvious
way to do this would be to embed general Plutus scripts in the submission
authorisation (or to allow Plutus scripts to construct proposals).  This could
involve some changes to ledger rules (including perhaps changes to script
plumbing), so should probably be seen as an extension to the base design, rather
than a core requirement.  \todo{Consider whether a script can be used for
  proposal submission rather than embedded signatures.  Does the two-phase Plutus process cause unwanted delays?}

For such an approach to be feasible, it would be necessary to determine whether
a proposal was permitted to be signed by a specific sub-group (i.e. the proposal
would need to be automatically checked and validated against the group
credentials).  It would also be necessary to set thresholds and quora
differently for different kinds of proposal.  These thresholds would need to be
independently validated through security audit.
