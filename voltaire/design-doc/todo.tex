  \hline \hline \stepcounter{todo}  \thetodo &
  Consider transaction costs for voting -- will this be off-putting?
  \\ \hline \stepcounter{todo} \thetodo &
  Confirm sizes of items in certificates
  \\ \hline \stepcounter{todo} \thetodo &
  Confirm required stability window deadlines
  \\ \hline \stepcounter{todo} \thetodo &
  Side-chain integration needs to be fleshed out, if required
  \\ \hline \stepcounter{todo} \thetodo &
  Efficiency needs to be properly evaluated
  \\ \hline \stepcounter{todo} \thetodo &
  A security audit needs to be done, and any issues addressed
  \\ \hline \stepcounter{todo}  \thetodo &
  Consider the composition and election of the submitter group
  \\ \hline \stepcounter{todo} \thetodo &
  Take legal advice where needed
  \\ \hline \stepcounter{todo} \thetodo &
  Redo the comparison with Priviledge
  \\ \hline \stepcounter{todo} \thetodo &
  Decide whether exchanges should be permitted to vote -- if not, token locking may be needed to prevent that, BUT that will impact participation levels
  \\ \hline \stepcounter{todo} \thetodo &
  Many specific details need to be discussed, and solutions found
  \\ \hline \hline
\end{tabular}
