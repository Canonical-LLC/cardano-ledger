\begin{tabular}{||p{0.25in}|p{5.7in}||}
  \hline \hline \stepcounter{todo}  \thetodo &
  Consider transaction costs for voting -- will this be off-putting?  How can we reduce friction?
  \\ \hline \stepcounter{todo} \thetodo &
  Do limits need to be placed on the number of votes that a delegate can have (as with the k parameter for stake pools)?
  \\ \hline \stepcounter{todo} \thetodo &
  Is stake the correct metric for determining voter rights?  How else can they be determined fairly (eg economic activity)?
  \\ \hline \stepcounter{todo} \thetodo &
  Are there sufficient checks and balances in the system to ensure that nonsensical proposals are not enacted?
  \\ \hline \stepcounter{todo} \thetodo &
  Confirm the number of transfers per-MIR proposal
  \\ \hline \stepcounter{todo} \thetodo &
  Consider grouped proposals to reduce the number of votes that are required
  \\ \hline \stepcounter{todo} \thetodo &
  Can we break down the submitter groups for different kinds of proposals into a more granular form (and how would we decide on eg thresholds, group composition)?
  \\ \hline \stepcounter{todo} \thetodo &
  What is the actual governance system (this design should support the chosen system, without limiting it unnecessarily)?
  \\ \hline \stepcounter{todo} \thetodo &
  Confirm sizes of items in certificates
  \\ \hline \stepcounter{todo} \thetodo &
  Confirm required stability window deadlines
  \\ \hline \stepcounter{todo} \thetodo &
  Side-chain integration needs to be fleshed out, if required
  \\ \hline \stepcounter{todo} \thetodo &
  Efficiency needs to be properly evaluated
  \\ \hline \stepcounter{todo} \thetodo &
  A security audit needs to be done, and any issues addressed
  \\ \hline \stepcounter{todo}  \thetodo &
  Consider the composition and election of the submitter group
  \\ \hline \stepcounter{todo} \thetodo &
  Take legal advice where needed
  \\ \hline \stepcounter{todo} \thetodo &
  Redo the comparison with Priviledge
  \\ \hline \stepcounter{todo} \thetodo &
  Decide whether exchanges should be permitted to vote -- if not, token locking may be needed to prevent that, BUT that will impact participation levels
  \\ \hline \stepcounter{todo} \thetodo &
  Many specific details need to be discussed, and solutions found
  \\ \hline \hline

%% Done
%  Votes can never be lost
%  Check terminology: addresses, certificates, keys
%   Change the diagrams to show that voting and endorsement can be independent
