\section{Rewards and Incentives Mechanisms (On-Chain and Off-Chain)}
\label{sect:rewards}

No on-chain rewards are currently envisioned for either voters or delegates.   Rewards may be offered as incentives for participating in the off-chain voting process through
the Catalyst system.  It is expected that these rewards will cover normal voting costs in terms of transaction fees etc.
