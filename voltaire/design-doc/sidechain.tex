\section{Tracking Proposals through a Side-Chain}

It has been suggested that a specific proposal could be submitted on-chain, with voting on the proposal tracked through a side-chain, such as Catalyst.
While it is probably not sensible to include this in the initial design, since it would add complexity and delay implementation, a system such as this
may be worth considering in future.

\subsection*{Main Advantages.}

\begin{tabular}{||l|p{4.5in}||}
  \hline\hline
  Reuse
  & Side-chain mechanisms are already being developed for other purposes (Hydra), so it might be possible to reuse existing design/implementation work.
  \\ \hline
  Automated Submission
  & A proposal could be submitted automatically on-chain, once a vote was accepted.
  \\ \hline
  Automated Tracking
  & The evolution of a proposal could be tracked automatically.
  \\ \hline

\end{tabular}

\subsection*{Main Disadvantages.}

\begin{tabular}{||l|p{4.5in}||}
  \hline\hline
  Additional Work/Risk &
  Tracking the vote on a proposal correctly could require significant work to be completed on side-chain integration, so delaying the project as a whole.
  \\\hline
  Fit with Catalyst &
  The intention is to use Catalyst for voting, so the mechanism must integrate with the Catalyst chain.
  \\\hline
  Implementation Timing & A proposal will typically only be crystallised into a form that can be submitted on-chain (implemented) \emph{after} it has been approved by an off-chain vote.
  This can involve a significant amount of work and perhaps financial support.
  It is important that any system that tracks the prpgress a proposal through a side-chain does not require it to be crystallised before it has been approved for implementation.

Changes to side-chain proposal tracking could affect the on-chain submission process, but should have no impact on the remainder of the on-chain process.
