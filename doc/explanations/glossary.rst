Native Tokens Glossary

Asset group - a collection of tokens/assets that share the same forging policy.
Custom token - a token featuring custom, user-defined functionality.
Forging - the action of minting or burning tokens. A negative forging amount indicates burning tokens, and a positive amount indicates minting new tokens.
Forging transaction - transactions with a field specifying token forging details. These transactions also carry the forging policies to be checked during validation.
Fungible token/asset - an asset that is interchangeable and indistinguishable with some other asset(s). Same denomination bills and coins are fungible assets, for example, like equal quantities of ada to lovelaces.
multi-asset (MA) - ledgers that support accounting or transaction of more than one type of asset are considered to have 'multi-asset' functionality. These ledgers can include blockchains, wallets, cryptocurrencies, or banking platforms, for example. Multi-assets usually include a platform's primary currency and multiple, user-defined assets.
multisig - simple scripting language supported by Cardano Shelley. Multisig specifies a minimal set of signatures required to allow a transaction to perform certain actions, and can also be used to specify simple forging policies.
native token - a token type accounting and tracking of which is natively supported by its underlying platform without a need for additional software.
non-fungible token/asset - a unique asset that is not interchangeable with any other asset(s). Non-fungible assets represent specific information (IP rights for example), and act as one unit that cannot be divided into smaller fractions.
one-time forging policy - a type of forging policy where the complete set of tokens of a given asset group is forged by a single transaction. Same tokens cannot be forged again.
principal currency - on a cryptocurrency platform, this refers to a type of a token/asset that is used for administrative purposes, such as paying fees, delegating to a stake pool, or being minted. Cardano’s primary currency is ada, Bitcoin’s is bitcoin.
securitization - the process of creating liquid, asset-backed securities from pools of illiquid assets.
security token - a digital asset that derives its value from an external asset that can be traded. Usually, it represents stocks, bonds, or revenue participation notes. Security tokens are subject to federal law governing regulations.
single-issuer policy - a forging policy that allows only the entity holding a particular set of keys (specified in the policy) to forge tokens of the associated asset group.
token builder - a piece of software that allows users to define tokens to be forged in a forging transaction.
token bundle - a collection of mixed tokens belonging to one or more different asset groups, usually stored in a single output.
token burning - the process of removing a token from circulation, (destroying the token).
token - cryptographic token that represents a footprint of value defined by the community, market state, or self-governed entity. A token can be fungible or non-fungible, and act as a payment unit, reward, trading asset, or information holder.
tokenization - the process of representing real-world assets with digital tokens.
token minting - the process of creating new tokens.
utility token - a digital token that holds certain functionality in regards to a concrete project or environment. These tokens can be used as payment units, rewards, or grant access to a specific network.
